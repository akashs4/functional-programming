Predicate: A Predicate<T> takes in one param of type T and returns a boolean result to indicate a decision for whatever check it represents.
Used by methods like filter() to make a go-no go decision.

Function: A Function<T, R> represents a function that takes a param of type T and returns a result of type R. 
- It is more general and can be used anywhere we want to transform an input to another value. 
- Used in method like map() whose aim is to transform the input from one type to another.
- T and R both can be same type too. Example: transforming a list of string to list of uppercase strings using map().

Optional class: Useful when result may be absent. Protects us from getting Null pointer by accident and makes it evident to user that 
"no result found" is a possible solution.

Reduce method: iterates over collection and also carries forward the result of the computation that the lambda expression returned.

BinaryOperator: operation upon two operands of same type producing a result of same type

collect() is also a reduce operation but it delegates the actual implementation to a Collector

Collector acts as a sink object to receive elements passed by collect() and stores them in desired format: ArrayList, String, etc.

How Java compiler knows when to pass parameter as the target or argument in method reference in static and instance methods?
Java compiler checks if it's an instance method, parameter becomes target, if it's static method, parameter becomes argument

What is Higher Order Method?
That creates and returns another functional expression with no side effect.

Supplier: no args, returns a result.

collect() method needs 3 information:
1- how to make result container?(ArrayList::new)
2- how to add single element to result container?(ArrayList::add)
3- how to add all elements to result container?(ArrayList::addAll)

Collectors utility:
-has methods like: toList(), toCollection(TreeSet::new), joining(", ") to concatenate
-has summingInt(Employee::getSalary) -> sums the salary of all the employees
-partitioningBy() method, to partition students into passing and failing 
Map<Boolean, List<Student>> passingFailing = students.stream().collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(s -> s.getGrade() >= PASS_THRESHOLD));

FilenameFilter: Instances of classes that implement this Interface are used to filter filenames

DirectoryStream: to iterate over the entries in a directory. A directory stream allows for the convenient use of the for-each construct
to iterate over a directory

flatMap merge a null reference to a Stream as an empty collection.

WatchService: can use this to watch the registered objects for changes and events.
